/**
A connection to the Pathfinder service, specific to one authenticated user belonging to a single application.

This is the starting point for all interactions with Pathfinder. The typical use case of this library is:

1. Retrieve a Cluster, either by id or the default cluster of the application. All transports, commodities and routes within specific clusters. Additional clusters can be configured via the Pathfinder web interface.
2. Register the device as a transport by creating a new transport instance or requesting transportation by create a commodity.
3. Create a delegate object for the newly created transport or commodity.
4. Subscribe to the vehicle, commodity or any other vehicles or commodities to receive status and location updates.
4. Respond to the CommodityDelegate or TransportDelegate protocol methods by displaying them on a MapView and executing the appropriate business logic.
