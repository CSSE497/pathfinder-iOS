Receives notifications of updates to a Commodity within the context of the specific application.

The standard use cases are to notify the requesting user that a transport has been dispatched to transport them or to observe the state of a commodity in transit from a third part perspective. Note that the transport is responsible for notifying the service that it has picked up or dropped off a commodity, not the commodity itself.
