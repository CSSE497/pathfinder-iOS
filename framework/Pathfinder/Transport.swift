/**
A registered transport that can be routed to transport commodities.

This class should never be instantiated directly because it represents the state of the data from the Pathfinder backend. Instead, connect your device as a transport.

The standard use case involves creating a new vehicle within a known cluster. This can be accomplished as follows:

```swift
let pathfinder = Pathfinder(pathfinderAppId, userCreds)
let params = ["passenger": 3, "suitecase": 4]
let transport = pathfinder.cluster("/USA/West/Seattle").createTransport(params)
transport.delegate = self
transport.connect()
```
