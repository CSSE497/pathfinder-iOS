/**
A list of actions that a vehicle is tasked with. This class provides several view methods to convert the data to a convenient format for plotting or logging. The route is update in real-time by the Pathfinder service. To be notified of updates, you will need to implement one of ClusterDelegate, CommodityDelegate or VehicleDelegate.

This class should never be instantiated directly because it represents the state of the data from the Pathfinder backend. Instead, routes can be obtained by querying Cluster, Vehicle or Commodity object properties or by instantiating a ClusterDelegate, CommodityDelegate or VehicleDelegate.
