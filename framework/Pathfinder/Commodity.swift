/**
A commodity that has requested transportation via your application.

This class should never be instantiated directly because it represents the state of the data from the Pathfinder backend. Instead, request commodity transportation via the helper method in the Pathfinder class.

```
let clusterToRouteIn = self.cluster
let start = CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: startLat, longitude: startLng)
let end = CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: endLat, longitude: endLng)
let parameters = [String:Int]()
parameters["people"] = 2
parameters["sheep"] = 0
pathfinder.requestCommodityTransit(cluster: clusterToRouteIn, start: start, destination: end, parameters: parameters) { (c:Commodity) -> Void in
  c.delegate = self
  self.drawCommodityOnMap(c)
}
```

The primary purpose of creating a commodity is to set its delegate. The delegate will receive updates on the status of the commodity as defined in `CommodityDelegate`.
